#  GymShop – eCommerce Presentation Website LINK : https://gymshop-iil3.onrender.com

**GymShop** is an early-stage eCommerce startup concept, and this project represents its first iteration — a product presentation website built entirely with **Django** on the backend and basic **HTML/CSS/JS** on the frontend.

## About the Project

This is the **first website I've ever built**, and I chose to use Django because I already had experience with Python. While Django isn't the fastest or most modern choice for frontend-heavy applications, it allowed me to focus on developing the core logic and structure of a working eCommerce system.

The project was created primarily for learning purposes, and it helped me understand the flow of a real-world web application from scratch, including:

- Setting up models and relationships (Products, Categories, Orders, Users)
- Integrating image storage via **Cloudinary**
- Connecting to a **PostgreSQL** database hosted on **Supabase**
- Building out custom admin interfaces using **Django Admin**
- Implementing tags and metadata using third-party Django packages

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Django (Python)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, vanilla JS

## System Architecture



The system is made up of a Django backend that connects to Supabase (PostgreSQL) and handles static & dynamic content, while product images are uploaded to Cloudinary. The admin panel allows full control over product listings and categories.

## Status

This is a **personal project** under active learning and development. It’s not yet a full production-ready platform, but it serves as a solid foundation for future expansion into a more advanced and scalable eCommerce product.
